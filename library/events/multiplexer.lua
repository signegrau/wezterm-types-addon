---The `mux-is-process-stateful` event is emitted when the multiplexer layer
---wants to determine whether a given `Pane` can be closed
---without prompting the user.
---
--- - This event is synchronous and must return as quickly as possible
---  in order to avoid blocking the multiplexer
--- - The event is passed a `LocalProcessInfo` object representing the process
---  that corresponds to the pane
---
---The hook can return one of the following values:
--- - `true`: to indicate that this process tree is considered to be stateful
---        and that the user should be prompted before terminating the pane
--- - `false`: to indicate that the process tree can be terminated without prompting the user
---
---Any other value means to use the default behavior, which is to consider the
---`skip_close_confirmation_for_processes_named` configuration option
---

---The `mux-startup` event is emitted once when the mux server is starting up.
---It is triggered before any default program is started.
---
---If the `mux-startup` event causes any panes to be created then
---those will take precedence over the default program configuration
---and no additional default program will be spawned.
---
---This event is useful for starting a set of programs in a standard configuration
---to save you the effort of doing it manually each time
