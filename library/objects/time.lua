---@field rise Time|nil
---@field progression number
---@field set Time|nil
---@field up boolean

---Represents a date and time that is tracked internally as UTC.
---
---Using `tostring()` on a Time object will show
---the internally tracked UTC time information
---@class Time
---Formats the time object as a string, using the local date/time representation of the time.
---
---The format string supports the [set of formatting placeholders described here](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)
---@field format fun(self: Time, format: string): string

---@field format_utc fun(self: Time, format: string): string
---For the date component of the time object,
---compute the times of the sun rise and sun set for the given latitude and longitude.
---
---For the time component of the time object,
---compute whether the sun is currently up,
---and the progression of the sun through either the day or night.
---
---Returns that information as a `Time.SunTimes` table.
---
---This information is potentially useful if you want to vary
---color scheme or other configuration based on the time of day.
---
---If the provided `latitude` and `longitude` specify a location
---at one of the poles, then the day or night may be longer than 24 hours.
---In that case the `rise` and `set` values will be `nil`,
---`progression` will be `0` and `up` will indicate either
---if it is polar daytime (`true`) or polar night time (`false`)
