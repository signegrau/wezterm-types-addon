---@class TlsDomainClient
---@field name string
---The name of this specific domain.  Must be unique amongst
---all types of domain in the configuration file.
---@field bootstrap_via_ssh string
---If set, use ssh to connect, start the server, and obtain
---a certificate.
---The value is "user@host:port", just like "wezterm ssh" accepts.
---@field remote_address string
---identifies the host:port pair of the remote server.
---@field pem_private_key string
---the path to an x509 PEM encoded private key file
---@field pem_cert string
---the path to an x509 PEM encoded certificate file
---@field pem_ca string
---the path to an x509 PEM encoded CA chain file
---@field pem_root_certs string[]
---A set of paths to load additional CA certificates.
---Each entry can be either the path to a directory or to a PEM encoded
---CA file.  If an entry is a directory, then its contents will be
---loaded as CA certs and added to the trust store.
---@field accept_invalid_hostnames boolean
---explicitly control whether the client checks that the certificate
---presented by the server matches the hostname portion of
---`remote_address`.  The default is true.  This option is made
---available for troubleshooting purposes and should not be used outside
---of a controlled environment as it weakens the security of the TLS
---channel.
---@field expected_cn string
---the hostname string that we expect to match against the common name
---field in the certificate presented by the server.  This defaults to
---the hostname portion of the `remote_address` configuration and you
---should not normally need to override this value.
---@field connect_automatically boolean
---If true, connect to this domain automatically at startup
---@field read_timeout integer
---@field write_timeout integer
---@field local_echo_threshold_ms integer
---The path to the wezterm binary on the remote host
---@field remote_wezterm_path string
---Show time since last response when waiting for a response.
---It is recommended to use
---<https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/lua/pane/get_metadata.html#since_last_response_ms>
---instead.
---@field overlay_lag_indicator boolean
